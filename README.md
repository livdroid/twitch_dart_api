Twitch Client is a package that allows you to connect with the Twitch API and
interact with data like Bits, Channels, Chats, Games, and Moderation ...
Twitch API documentation: <https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api>>

# Features

## Getting started

Register an app here : <https://dev.twitch.tv/console>
The redirection URL and the client id are needed to connect with the API.

## Usage

Create a TwitchInterface object.

```dart
var twitchInterface = TwitchInterface(
    redirectionURL: 'url',
    clientid: 'clientID';
```

Retrieve the URL you will use in a webview to let the user connect with its account.
The method getConnectionUrl must have a list of scopes, all scopes are available
in the library.

````dart
final uri = twitchInterface.getConnectionUrl(
              scopes: TwitchApiScopes.allScopes);
````

Once the connection is done, the redirection URL will contain the user access token.
Something like:
Give the URL that was returned after using logged in to the package and it will
parse the URL to keep the access token and add it to the TwitchInterface, this information is not kept across sessions, you will have to do this logic yourself.

```dart
twitchInterface.init(url: 'url');
```

## Additional information

IMPORTANT: Verify token

As per twitch documentation, you should validate the access token every hour,
they can audit your app and ask you to resolve the issue if you don't do it.
More here: <https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/authentication/validate-tokens#who-must-validate-tokens>

Please call validateToken() to do this request.
